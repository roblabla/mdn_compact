# mdn\_compact

A compact theme for the MDN.

Recently, mozilla did a complete redesign of the MDN. I find it pretty, but it
eats a *lot* of screen real estate. The worse offender is on mobile, where the
website basically looks like crap, but even tablet and desktop users are left
with a lot of wasted space.

This theme tries to recover this lost space by moving some stuff around. On
mobile, it removes search and menues. I'll try to put them back in if I find the
time.

You can find this theme on
